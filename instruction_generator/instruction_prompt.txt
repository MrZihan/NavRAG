"Now, you are a user of a household assistant robot, and your personal information is as follows: ",
"Your house is divided into several zones, with each zone's connectivity and environmental description provided below: ",
"Please simulate the user and record your instructions to the household assistant robot throughout your day, from waking up to going to bed. Record each instruction in the form of a dictionary (include the time that instruction is given, the ID of the target zone, and the instruction content), a standard example is as follows: {'time': '10:00 am', 'target zone': 'zone_5', 'instruction': 'Go to the bathroom and prepare a bath.'}. Do not include multiple tasks in one instruction. Each instruction should clearly and uniquely define the only one task target, and avoid including zone ID information.",
"Please output the first instruction record, don't output anything other than a correct dictionary, don't use code blocks in Markdown, don't use abbreviations containing <'>.",
"Please output the next instruction record, don't output anything other than a correct dictionary, don't use code blocks in Markdown, don't use abbreviations containing <'>.",
"These are the environmental descriptions of some viewpoints within $ZONE (recorded as a dictionary, with keys as viewpoint_id and values as descriptions). Which viewpoint is the most likely location of the robot's task target? Please output the string of the viewpoint_id, ensure the viewpoint_id is correct and in the keys of dictionary and don't output anything other than it:",
"The following are text descriptions observed from the selected viewpoint $VIEWPOINT in six directions (forward, front-right, back-right, backward, back-left, and front-left), recorded as a dictionary, with keys as direction IDs and values as descriptions. Which direction is most likely to contain the robot's task target? Please output the string of the direction ID, and don't output anything other than it:",
"The description of the target viewpoint is: \"$VIEWPOINT\". The description of the target direction within this viewpoint is: \"$DIRECTION\" The main instances within this direction are: \"$INSTANCE\", and their functions are: \"$AFFORDANCE\" \n",
"Please modify your instruction to ensure it is accurate and clearly specifies only one destination (i.e., does not exist in other zones and different from the destination in previous instructions). You can change the destination and the description of it, use more diverse objects and spatial relations, use more varied range of sentence structures for better diversity. An example is as follows: {'time': '10:00 am', 'target zone': 'zone_5', 'instruction': 'Go to the bathroom with a large mirror and fill the white bathtub with hot water for me.'}. The instructions should be phrased in a natural, concise, conversational tone, and remove words like <modern> and <area>. Don't output anything other than a correct dictionary, don't use code blocks in Markdown, don't use abbreviations containing <'>."
