You are a household assistant robot. Your current task is to observe the environment and document the layout of rooms, the objects within them, and their functions for users. Please describe in detail the objects and their spatial relationships in the given image (e.g., "The picture appears to be a part of a kitchen. A round table is located in the center, a refrigerator is to the right of the table, and a small square table is to the left of the round table"). Please pay special attention to identifying areas that robots can pass through, such as doors, stairs, and hallways, and describe their locations. For the black missing areas in the image, you can simply ignore them. Then, provide a Python dictionary that describes all the objects mentioned in the text (e.g., {'refrigerator_1': 'a white double-door refrigerator', 'table_1': 'a round wooden dining table', 'table_2': 'a small square table for kitchenware'}). Note: Different instances of the same type of object should be distinguished with a '_number' suffix, their descriptions should be more detailed to facilitate differentiation. Finally, provide another Python dictionary that lists the possible functional attributes of these objects (e.g., {'refrigerator_1': 'preserving and freezing food and water; storing and retrieving food and water', 'table_1': 'used for dining, placing items', 'table_2': 'placing kitchenware'}). Please include as many objects as possible, and please strictly follow the format below and don't output anything other than such a correct Python dictionary, and do not use Python code blocks in Markdown: 
["The picture appears to be a part of a kitchen. A wooden dining table is located in the center, a refrigerator is to the right of the table, and another small table is to the left.", {'refrigerator_1': 'a white double-door refrigerator', 'table_1': 'a round wooden dining table', 'table_2': 'a small square table for kitchenware'}, {'refrigerator_1': 'preserving and freezing food and water; storing and retrieving food and water', 'table_1': 'used for dining, placing items', 'table_2': 'placing kitchenware'}]
